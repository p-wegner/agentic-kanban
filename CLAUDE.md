# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status
This project is in **pre-implementation**. Tech stack and architecture are TBD. All decisions are tracked in `docs/decisions/` and progress in `docs/state.md`.

## What This Is
Cleanroom reimplementation of [vibe-kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) — a kanban board for managing AI-driven coding tasks. Personal use only, single user, local-first. The original (being sunset) is 34 Rust crates; we're building a focused alternative.

## Key Constraints
- **Claude Code only** as the AI agent (no multi-agent support)
- **Local only** — no cloud, no multi-tenant, no OAuth
- **Testability first** — E2E tests from day one, AI-runnable feedback loops
- **Tech stack TBD** — see `docs/decisions/001-initial-scope.md` for options (Python/FastAPI or TypeScript leading)
- **PR creation is skipped** — manual merge only
- Use `uv` and `uv venv` for any Python work (never global site-packages)
- Windows environment

## Documentation Map
- `docs/prd/00-executive-summary.md` — vision, keep/skip list
- `docs/prd/05-mvp-scope.md` — MVP definition, 6-stage plan, feature matrix
- `docs/prd/03-data-model.md` — core entities (Project, Issue, Workspace, Session)
- `docs/prd/04-agent-integration.md` — MCP tools, agent lifecycle
- `docs/prd/06-testability-strategy.md` — test pyramid, per-stage test plans
- `docs/decisions/` — numbered decision records
- `docs/diary.md` — session log for talk/presentation material
- `docs/state.md` — current progress tracking

## MVP Core Loop
Create issue → Start workspace (git branch) → Launch Claude Code → View diff → Merge

## Reference Codebase
The original vibe-kanban is at `F:/projects/vibe-kanban` for reference. Key files:
- `crates/mcp/src/task_server/` — MCP tool definitions
- `crates/db/migrations/` — database schema evolution
- `crates/api-types/src/` — shared type definitions
- `shared/types.ts` — generated TypeScript types
